Develop enviroment: Visual Studio Windows

Code:
The program implement linked list in c using pointers. The data is a struct with multiple variables. 
Every node of list contains a data struct and a pointer to next node.
Some basic action on the list have been implement, such as insertion, printing, removing...
The program doesn't accept command line arguments. It is interactive with the user,
as the user input every time the next action to performed.
New nodes add always at the end of the list.

The program separate to many files:
WorkingLab.c is the main function.
Node.c is the struct of data.
LinkedList.c is the linked list and her actions.
GeneralFunctions.c is some extra general functions.


Description:
The program is simulation of a lab that need to keep some integer values. 
Also accept and a small description for the values.
Every node with values represent a different result of an experiment.
